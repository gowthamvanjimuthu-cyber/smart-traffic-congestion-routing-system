# Smart Traffic Congestion and Routing System

**Team Name:** INFINITY  
**Hackathon:** TechSprint  


## Problem Statement
Traffic congestion in campus and nearby community roads causes delays, fuel wastage,
and inconvenience to daily commuters. Existing navigation applications mainly focus
on city-level routing and do not provide localized or smart alternative route options.

This project proposes a web-based Smart Traffic Congestion and Routing System that
helps users find optimized and alternate routes using live location or manual
start-point selection.



## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- Leaflet.js (Open-source map library)  
- OpenStreetMap (Map tiles)  
- OSRM Routing API (Route calculation)  
- Nominatim API (Location search)



## How to Run the Project

### Option 1: Run Locally
1. Download or clone the GitHub repository
2. Open the file `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Allow location access when prompted (for live location feature)
4. Select the start location and enter the destination to view routes

### Option 2: Run Online (MVP)
1. Open the live MVP link
2. Click **Use Live Location** or select a start point on the map
3. Enter the destination and choose **Search Route** or **Smart Route**



## Output / Result
- Detects live location using browser GPS
- Allows manual selection of start point by clicking on the map
- Displays normal navigation route similar to Google Maps
- Provides smart routing with multiple prioritized alternative paths
- Uses color-coded routes for easy traffic understanding
- Helps reduce travel time by avoiding congested routes

## Future Enhancements
- AI-based traffic congestion prediction
- Android mobile application version
- Integration with real-time traffic data
